Starting with 1 and spiralling anticlockwise in the following way, a square spiral with side length 7 is formed.

*37  36  35  34  33  32 *31
 38 *17  16  15  14 *13  30
 39  18  *5   4  *3  12  29
 40  19   6   1   2  11  28
 41  20  *7   8   9  10  27
 42  21  22  23  24  25  26
*43  44  45  46  47  48  49

It is interesting to note that the odd squares lie along the bottom right diagonal, 
but what is more interesting is that 8 out of the 13 numbers lying along both diagonals are prime; 
that is, a ratio of 8/13 â‰ˆ 62%.

If one complete new layer is wrapped around the spiral above, a square spiral with side length 9 will be formed. 
If this process is continued, what is the side length of the square spiral for which the ratio of primes along 
both diagonals first falls below 10%?
